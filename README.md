Shows a countdown for the time to phase change of traffic lights.
Includes a graphs that shows the countdown over time and the signal phase.

Running demo at https://kridhaen.github.io/OpenTrafficLightsPredictionVisualizer/

The predictions in this demo are calculated on the client-side. Historical data is build on the go, while the client is running. Therefor it can take a few minutes before predictions will appear and the predictions at the start are not accurate, because they lack historical data.

The code can be used to show predictions in 'latest' fragments that contain observations with the likelyTime field, that can be generated by https://github.com/kridhaen/OpenTrafficLightsPrediction.

To visualize predictions made by a server, edit dataSetUrl prop in ./src/App.js and set clientSidePrediction prop to false.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
